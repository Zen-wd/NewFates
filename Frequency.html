                ???, also known as Hadenstein, appeared very suddenly in a channel called "The Frequency" and was the first person we met. He is very powerful and for a long time we did not know his name, so we called him "Mark" short for "Question Mark". Despite being initially wary, Mark is someone we've grown to trust.

                We met Reuben when Nachos and Riot accidentally broke into his cave whilst on a trip with the Familiar <a href="Answer"style="text-decoration: none; color:#3B2021;">Tango</a>. Despite the warning signs they entered the cave and found him. We were nervous he'd be mad, but he was very chill and is now very trusted, even if Mark doesn't particularly like him.
