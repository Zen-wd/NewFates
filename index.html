            The Copper Ruins Initiative began in response to a server that was going nowhere. The leader of this initiative, Nimh, gathered together similarly unhappy members and together banded together to bring their complaints to light. In the end, they decided that it'd be best to separate from the server itself, creating a new one for them to exist in called "New Fates". Now the members get to experience great turmoil as their stories unfold, heralded by Nimh.

              New Fates is a Minecraft SMP that consists of 22 members. Tese members have been given invites to this island under the guise of searching for a treasure their character would want to rexeive. The treasure isn't obvious before their eyes, and the more they explore this island the more secrets and mysteries arise. Such as who this mysterious person who communicates through the Frequency is, what the familiars they've grown to love are and where they came from, and even what the mysterious treasure may be. Only as they adventure and bond more will the answers to these questions come to light. Whether or not the players are preapred for them is another problem in and of itself.
